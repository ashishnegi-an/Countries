![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding assignment](design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The assignment

Your assignment is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs via React or any JS library/framework

You have complete control over which packages and library you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
- On searching if no country found then have graceful error handling like 


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

In this assignment, you will find mobile and desktop designs in light and dark mode color schemes for both pages.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to see sizes etc, it is available to download from the assignment page on the site.

There are no assets for this assignment, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

There is a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Practice using version control by creating your own GitHub repository for this assignment. This has the added benefit of being able to publish the site for free on GitHub Pages. Find out more about GitHub Pages here: [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com).

Also, you could try building this project in a team. This is a great way to practice collaborative coding.

## Suggested workflow

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
